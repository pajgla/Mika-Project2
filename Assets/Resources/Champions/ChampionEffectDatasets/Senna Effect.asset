  m_EffectName: Absolution
  m_EffectDescription: 'When units die near Senna, their souls are periodically trapped
    by the Black Mist. Senna can attack these souls to free them, absorbing the Mist
    that held them in death. Mist fuels her Relic Cannon''s power with increased
    Attack Damage, Attack Range, and Critical Strike Chance.

    

    Attacks
    from Senna''s Relic Cannon take longer to fire, deal bonus damage, and briefly
    grant her a portion of her target''s Move Speed.'
