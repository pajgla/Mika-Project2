  m_ChampionDescription: 'Jhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder
    is art. Once an Ionia Crest icon.png Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements
    within Ionia''s ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal''s
    assassin. Using his gun gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic
    brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting
    on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal choice to send the most powerful
    of messages: terror.'
