  m_ChampionDescription: A demonic amalgamation drawn from the nightmares that haunt
    every sentient mind, the thing known as Nocturne Nocturne has become a primordial
    force of pure terror. It is liquidly chaotic in aspect, a faceless shadow with
    cold eyes and armed with wicked-looking blades. After freeing itself from the
    spirit realm, Nocturne now continually descends upon the waking world, to feed
    on the kind of fear that can only thrive in true darkness.
