  m_ChampionDescription: "Cursed from childhood to be haunted by the supernatural
    Black Mist, Senna joined a sacred order known as the Sentinels of Light Crest
    icon.svg Sentinels of Light, and fiercely fought back\u2014only to be killed:
    her soul imprisoned in a lantern by the cruel wraith Thresh Thresh. But refusing
    to lose hope, within the lantern Senna learned to use the Mist, and reemerged
    to new life, forever changed. Now wielding darkness along with light, Senna seeks
    to end the Black Mist by turning it against itself\u2014with every blast of her
    relic weapon, redeeming the souls lost within."
