  m_ChampionDescription: "Equal parts jolly and imposing, Gragas Gragas is a massive,
    rowdy brewmaster on his own quest for the perfect pint of ale. Hailing from parts
    unknown, he now searches for rare ingredients among the unblemished wastes of
    the Freljord Crest icon.png Freljord, trying each recipe as he goes. Often intoxicated
    and extremely impulsive, he is legendary for the brawls he starts, which often
    end in all-night parties and widespread property damage. Any appearance from
    Gragas must surely foreshadow drinking and destruction\u2014in that order."
